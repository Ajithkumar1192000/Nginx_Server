            <p>A waterfall model is a planning process used to develop a product or component from start to finish. It consists of five steps or phases that represent th key phases of project creation. The steps are feasibility study, requirements analysis, design, programming, testing and maintenance.</p>

            <center><h4>AGILE MODEL</h4></center>
            <center><img id="img3"src="https://static.javatpoint.com/difference/images/agile-vs-waterfall-model.png"/></center>
            <p>The Agile model is a flexible, iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration,customer satisfaction, and adaptive planning. It was introduced in response to the limitations of waterfall model,which could be more flexible and adapt to chnaging project needs</p>

    <h5>What is DevOps lifecycle & how does it work?</h5>
    <p>
        The DevOps lifecycle is an automated, iterative development process represented by an infinity loop, emphasizing continuous collaboration. It integrates development, testing, deployment, and operations stages, with technology stacks tailored to each phase. The left side focuses on development and testing, while the right side handles deployment and operations.
    </p>
    <h6>steps:</h6>
    <p>
        1.	Plan: Teams define business requirements and create a project roadmap.<br/>
        2.	Code: Development occurs with tools like Git to ensure code quality.<br/>
        3.	Build: Code is committed to a shared repository using build tools like Maven or Gradle.<br/>
        4.	Test: Various tests are conducted in a test environment using tools like JUnit and Selenium.<br/>
        5.	Release: Builds passing all tests are scheduled for deployment to the production environment.<br/>
        6.	Deploy: Infrastructure-as-Code is used to build the production environment and deploy the build.<br/>
        7.	Operate: Operations teams configure and provision servers using tools like Chef.<br/>
        8.	Monitor: Continuous monitoring of the DevOps pipeline helps identify and address bottlenecks.

                <p>
                 <b> 1.Continuous Development:</b>
Continuous development in DevOps is about ongoing project planning and coding, adapting to changes and feedback. Nordstrom's shift to DevOps from the waterfall model improved their app's quality and release frequency. Tools like GitLab, Git, and Jira facilitate version control and collaboration in this phase, enabling teams to streamline their processes and enhance product development.
<br/>
<b>2.Continuous Integration:</b>
Continuous integration in DevOps is pivotal for integrating updated code and features seamlessly while detecting and addressing bugs through continuous testing. DocuSign's adoption of DevOps improved their e-signature technology by implementing tools like Mock for internal API, enhancing development and delivery efficiency. Tools like Jenkins, Bamboo, and GitLab CI aid in smooth project workflows and productivity. It's crucial to select tools aligned with business and project needs.
<br/>
<b>3.Continuous Testing:</b>
Continuous testing in DevOps involves ongoing bug detection and issue resolution, either before or after integration, using tools like Selenium and Docker containers. Automation testing streamlines processes, enhances test evaluation reports, and reduces provisioning and maintenance costs of test environments. Tools like JUnit, Selenium, TestNG, and TestSigma support continuous testing, with Selenium being widely used for its versatility, and TestSigma offering AI-driven automation capabilities.

<br/>
<b>4.Continuous Development:</b>
Continuous deployment in DevOps involves deploying final code to production servers, ensuring accurate and smooth deployment through configuration management and containerization tools like Docker. Adobe leverages DevOps and CloudMunch's platform for automated deployments, facilitating quick software updates and better product management. Configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef, along with containerization tools like Docker and Vagrant, ensure consistency and scalability in the deployment process.
<br/>
<b>5.Continuous Feedback:</b>
Continuous feedback in DevOps involves analyzing customer behavior regularly to improve application code and future releases. Tangerine bank utilized continuous feedback to enhance its mobile experience, quickly addressing customer concerns and improving the application accordingly. Tools like Pendo and Qentelli's TED aid in collecting customer reviews and insights, facilitating actionable improvements in the DevOps process.
<br/>
<b>6.Continuous Monitoring:</b>
Continuous monitoring in DevOps involves constant monitoring of application functionality and features to detect system errors and performance issues promptly. Tools like Nagios, Kibana, and New Relic facilitate fast and efficient continuous monitoring, enabling quick identification and resolution of issues. Additionally, security issues can be automatically detected and addressed during this phase, ensuring the application's stability and security.
                <br/>
<b>7.Continuous Operations:</b>
Continuous operations in the DevOps lifecycle focus on reducing planned downtime by automating the process of launching app updates. Container management systems like Kubernetes and Docker eliminate downtime, ensuring uninterrupted services and accelerating time-to-market. Tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are used for high availability and faster deployment in continuous operations
