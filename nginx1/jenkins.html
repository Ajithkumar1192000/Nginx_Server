            <h1><center>INTRODUCTION TO JENKINS</center></h1>
            <b>What is Continuous Integration? </b>
            <p>Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice in which the developers are needs to commit changes to the source code in a shared repository at regular intervals. Every commit made in the repository is then built. This allows the development teams to detect the problems early.
              Continuous integration requires the developers to have regular builds. The general practice is that whenever a code commit occurs, a build should be triggered.</p>
             <p>
             <b>What is jenkins?  </b><br/>
Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java programming language that allows 
continuous integration. 
Jenkins builds and tests our software projects which continuously making it easier for 
developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh 
build. 
It also allows us to continuously deliver our software by integrating with a large number of 
testing and deployment technologies. 
Jenkins offers a straightforward way to set up a continuous integration or continuous delivery 
environment for almost any combination of languages and source code repositories using 
pipelines, as well as automating other routine development tasks. 
With the help of Jenkins, organizations can speed up the software development process 
through automation. Jenkins adds development life-cycle processes of all kinds, including 
build, document, test, package, stage, deploy static analysis and much more. 
Jenkins achieves CI (Continuous Integration) with the help of plugins. Plugins is used to 
allow the integration of various DevOps stages. If you want to integrate a particular tool, you 
have to install the plugins for that tool. For example: Maven 2 Project, Git, HTML Publisher, 
Amazon EC2, etc. 
For example: If any organization is developing a project, then Jenkins will continuously test 
your project builds and show you the errors in early stages of your development. 
Possible steps executed by Jenkins are for example: 
<ol>
<li>Perform a software build using a build system like Gradle or Maven Apache </li>
<li>Execute a shell script </li>
<li>Archive a build result </li>
<li>Running software tests </li>
</ol>

        <h3><center>Jenkins Architecture</center></h3>
<p>
  Certain needs could not be met with one Jenkins server. Firstly, we may need multiple distinct environments in which to test our builds. A single Jenkins server will not be able to do this. Secondly, if larger and heavier projects are being produced regularly, a single Jenkins server will be overwhelmed.
  Jenkins distributed architecture was created to meet the above requirements. Furthermore, Jenkins manages distributed builds using a Master-Slave architecture. The TCP/IP protocol is used to communicate between the Master and the Slave in this design.
  <br/>
 <b>Jenkins Master</b>
  The Jenkins master is in charge of scheduling the jobs, assigning slaves, and sending builds to slaves to execute the jobs. It’ll also keep track of the slave state (offline or online) and retrieve the build result responses from slaves and display them on the console output.
  <br/>
  <b>Jenkins Slave</b>
  It runs on the remote server. The Jenkins server follows the requests of the Jenkins master and is compatible with all operating systems. Building jobs dispatched by the master are executed by the slave. Also, the project can be configured to choose a specific slave machine.

              <b>Benefits of Using Jenkins</b>
•	Faster delivery cycles: Automated builds and deployments drastically reduce manual intervention and streamline the delivery process.<br/>
•	Improved software quality: Automated testing helps identify bugs early in the development cycle, leading to a more robust application.<br/>
•	Enhanced collaboration: Jenkins provides a central platform for developers and testers to track builds and collaborate effectively.<br/>
•	Reduced errors: Automation minimizes human error and ensures consistency in the delivery process.<br/>
•	Cost-effectiveness: Being open-source, Jenkins eliminates licensing costs, making it an attractive option for businesses of all sizes
